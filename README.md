# Crypto-Overview-Data-Analysis
Build a financial dashboard on any financial topic of your choice using publicly available data. The dashboard must be meaningful, visually polished, live, and easy to explain to a non-technical stakeholder.

# Project Overview 
Cryptocurrency Market, It is one of the fastest-moving financial markets in the world, where prices can change dramatically within minutes. Traditional static reports fail to capture this volatility, which makes the crypto overview dashboard not just useful but necessary.

The Crypto Overview Dashboard is built to answer several key questions that any crypto investor or analyst would ask on a daily basis. It tells you which coins are currently gaining or losing value by showing price changes across four different time intervals — 5 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, and 24 hours. It also shows you where the trading activity is concentrated by comparing volume across the five major coins. 
Beyond individual prices, the dashboard reveals which coins have the strongest market presence through their liquidity and market cap figures, and it makes the overall market sentiment immediately visible through the green🟢 and red🔴 color coding on every chart.
